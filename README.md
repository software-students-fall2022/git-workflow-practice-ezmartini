# Eduarda's Interesting Article: "Looking Back – Developing The Sims 2" 

Here's a [link] (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/looking-back-developing-the-sims-2/1100-6110073/) to the article. 


The Sims franchise has been, and still is, one of my favorite games to play since I was a kid. I remember downloading mods, and moving them into the appropiate folder so I could see them in the game. And then in later Sims games, having to get rid of buggy mods after an update. 

Reading this article, now that I'm older and studying CS, is fascinating. Reading about how collaboration and responsibilities were split up with sticky notes on a wall, and how devs would stamp sticky notes once a task was completed. It's cool seeing how inside jokes have made it into the game itself– the name of meeting room "Reticulating Splines" has been in all Sims games loading screens (I think), even in recent ones.

The article discusses The Sims 2, which is, to me, the most detailed game in the franchise: breaking the fourth wall when Sims needs are low, seeing rain drops fall from roofs, Sims shaking from too much coffee. And these details probably came from all different engineers on their team looking for "opportunities to toss an extra joke or two in the game."
